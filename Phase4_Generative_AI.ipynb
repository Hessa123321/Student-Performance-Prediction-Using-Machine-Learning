      "## Performance Summary\n",
      "The student's overall performance is concerning, with low engagement metrics evident in study hours (0.45), attendance rate (0.67), and previous grades (0.27). The lack of participation in extracurricular activities and a cluster group designation of 0 further indicates minimal involvement in the academic community. This combination suggests that the student may be struggling to find motivation or support in their studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biggest Weakness\n",
      "The weakest metric is the **Previous Grades** at 0.27, which reflects a significant challenge in academic achievement. This low performance often signifies difficulty with comprehension of course material, lack of effective study habits, or a disconnect from the learning environment. Addressing this weakness will be critical for the student's academic recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Strength\n",
      "One potential strength is the student’s **attendance rate** of 0.67. Though not optimal, it indicates that the student is making an effort to attend classes and engage with course content, suggesting a willingness to learn. This could serve as a foundation to build upon through additional academic support and resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommended Action Plan\n",
      "To improve performance, the following actionable steps are recommended:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Set a Study Schedule**: Establish a structured study routine, aiming for at least 5-10 hours of focused study per week. Break this time into manageable blocks, ensuring to cover all subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Engage in Class**: Actively participate in classes by asking questions and engaging with peers. This will enhance understanding and retention of material.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Seek Tutoring Support**: Access on-campus or online tutoring services for extra help with challenging subjects. Regular sessions can provide personalized guidance and accountability.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Join Study Groups**: Connect with classmates to create or join study groups. Collaborating with peers can foster a sense of community and aid in understanding complex topics through discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Explore Extracurricular Activities**: Get involved in at least one extracurricular activity, such as clubs or sports. Engaging in campus life can improve motivation and create social support networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Meet with an Academic Advisor Regularly**: Establish a routine for meetings with an academic advisor. These sessions can provide personalized feedback, set academic goals, and offer resources for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Cluster Insight\n",
      "**Cluster 0** typically includes students who may not be fully engaged in their academic environment. These students often show low levels of involvement both academically and socially, which can lead to challenges in motivation and performance. They might struggle with integrating into the academic setting, thus missing out on the benefits of peer support and resources. It is essential for students in this cluster to seek guidance and opportunities for involvement to enhance their overall academic experience. Building connections and finding support within their educational institution will be crucial for their success.\n",

      "### Performance Summary\n",
      "The student exhibits significant challenges in their academic performance, reflecting extremely low metrics across key indicators. With an average of only 0.65 study hours per week, a 55% attendance rate, and a prior grade average of just 0.28, the student is currently lagging behind the expected academic standards. These factors combined suggest a lack of engagement and may hinder the overall learning process. Additionally, involvement in just one extracurricular activity indicates limited connection to the school community, which can also impact motivation and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biggest Weakness\n",
      "The weakest metric for the student is the previous grades, which currently sits at 0.28. This score indicates a consistent struggle to grasp the curricular material and achieve satisfactory understanding or application of the coursework.

      "\n",
      "### Key Strength\n",
      "Despite the overall weakness in academic performance, the student is involved in one extracurricular activity. This participation demonstrates a willingness to engage with the school community, albeit to a limited extent, and can serve as a foundation for building social connections and increasing overall engagement in school life.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Action Plan\n",
      "1. **Increase Study Hours**: Aim to increase study hours to at least 3-4 hours per week. This can be done by setting a specific time each day dedicated to studying or revising class materials.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Improved Attendance**: Commit to improving attendance to at least 75%. Consider identifying barriers to attendance and seeking support, such as counseling or school resources that could address these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Academic Support**: Utilize tutoring services or peer study groups to aid understanding of challenging subjects. This support can provide additional resources and different perspectives on the material.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Goal-Setting**: Establish short-term and long-term academic goals. Aiming for incremental improvements in grades can help maintain motivation and provide a sense of accomplishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Engagement in Class**: Actively participate in class discussions or activities. Asking questions and seeking clarification can enhance understanding and retention of material.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Explore More Extracurriculars**: Consider joining additional clubs or activities aligned with personal interests. Increased involvement can build a supportive network that may enhance motivation for academic success.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cluster Insight\n",
      "Cluster 1 typically represents students who may struggle with various aspects of academic engagement. These students often exhibit lower study habits, inconsistent attendance, and lower academic performance. They may benefit from additional support mechanisms, including personalized mentoring and targeted academic strategies.

      "### Performance Summary\n",
      "The student is currently struggling across multiple academic metrics. With an exceptionally low study hour commitment of only 0.44 per week and an attendance rate of 63%, there is a clear indication of disengagement from their academic responsibilities. Previous grades at 0.34 further demonstrate a lack of satisfactory performance. Extra-curricular involvement is non-existent, which suggests limited engagement in the broader educational environment, potentially impacting both motivation and skill development. Overall, the student's academic performance is below average and requires immediate attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biggest Weakness\n",
      "The weakest metric is the **Study Hours per Week**, which sits at an alarming 0.44. This figure indicates that the student is virtually not engaging in any dedicated study outside of class time. This lack of study significantly contributes to the poor understanding of course material and low grades, as adequate study time is critical for retention and mastery of concepts. It is essential to develop a consistent study routine to foster better comprehension and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Strength\n",
      "One notable strength is the **Attendance Rate**, which, while not ideal at 63%, indicates that the student is at least attending classes. This basic level of engagement is a potential foundation upon which to build, as being present in class is the first step toward academic success. Attending lectures can facilitate knowledge acquisition and provide opportunities for the student to connect with peers and faculty, which can be leveraged to improve overall performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Action Plan\n",
      "To help improve performance and engagement in a meaningful way, consider the following actionable steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Establish a Study Schedule**:\n",
      "   - Encourage the student to set aside dedicated study hours each week, aiming for at least 5–10 hours. Create a calendar with specific times blocked out for studying to build a routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Set Attendance Goals**:\n",
      "   - Work with the student to set an attendance goal of at least 80% for the upcoming semester. Use a reward system (small incentives) to maintain motivation in attending classes regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Engage in Supplementary Resources**:\n",
      "   - Recommend that the student utilize available academic resources, such as tutoring services, study groups, or online courses, which can provide additional support and avenues for learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Review and Reflect on Previous Grades**:\n",
      "   - Schedule a meeting to review past grades, identify patterns or specific subjects of difficulty, and develop targeted strategies for improvement, including possible additional support from instructors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Participate in Extracurricular Activities**:\n",
      "   - Encourage the student to engage in at least one extracurricular activity that aligns with their interests. This can foster a sense of belonging and improve time management skills, which are crucial for academic success.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Regular Check-ins**:\n",
      "   - Set up bi-weekly check-in sessions to monitor progress, address any challenges, and modify the action plan as necessary. This ongoing support can help keep the student accountable and motivated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cluster Insight\n",
      "**Cluster 0** typically encompasses students who may be experiencing significant challenges in their academic journeys. Students in this cluster often exhibit low engagement levels, characterized by limited study habits, poor attendance, and minimal involvement in extracurricular activities. This group may benefit from structured support and intervention strategies tailored to increase both academic performance and personal well-being. \n",
      "\n",
      "Students in Cluster 0 often require heightened academic advising and support services to re-engage them in their educational pursuits. It’s critical to identify their unique barriers to success and provide consistent encouragement and resources to help them transition into more productive study habits and improved academic performance.\n",

    "(1) Template Comparison & Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing the results produced by the two prompt templates, distinct differences are apparent in terms of quality, detail, and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Template 1 generates brief, straightforward guidance, usually restricted to one or two sentences, concentrating solely on the key actions for enhancement like boosting study time or improving attendance. This allows for rapid and efficient responses in scenarios needing prompt feedback, yet it falls short in depth and contextual comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison, Template 2 provides a significantly more detailed and organized reply. It offers a detailed performance summary, pinpointing weaknesses (like poor grades or inadequate study hours), emphasizing strengths (such as good attendance), and presenting a multi-step plan for actionable improvement. Furthermore, it offers a cluster-based analysis, providing the student with a better understanding of how their performance measures up within their subgroup. This degree of detail renders Template 2 far more informative, more contextually appropriate, and more effective for substantial academic advising.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Final Template Selection & Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen prompt template for incorporation into the system is Template 2. This option is chosen for its capacity to provide a deeper, more organized, and educationally significant analysis in comparison to Template 1. Template 1 delivers swift and straightforward feedback, whereas Template 2 gives a more thorough insight into student performance by highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and specific steps for improvement. Its organized design showcasing a performance overview, in-depth rationale, and a cluster comparison improves clarity and facilitates knowledgeable academic choices. Hence, Template 2 aligns more closely with the system's objective of providing thorough, top-notch guidance that significantly aids student advancement."
